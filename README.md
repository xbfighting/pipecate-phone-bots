# Client/Server Web Example

Learn how to build web applications using Pipecat's client/server architecture. This approach separates your bot logic from your user interface, giving you full control over the client experience while maintaining real-time voice communication.

This example demonstrates:

- Server-side bot running with Pipecat
- React client using [Pipecat's client SDK](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/introduction)
- Real-time voice communication between client and server
- UI components from [voice-ui-kit](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/voice-ui-kit) for common voice interface patterns

This is the recommended architecture for web applications that need custom interfaces or client-side functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `npm` installed
- AI Service API keys for: [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/signup), [OpenAI](https://auth.openai.com/create-account), and [Cartesia](https://play.cartesia.ai/sign-up)

## Setup

This example requires running both a server and client in **two separate terminal windows**.

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-quickstart-client-server.git
cd pipecat-quickstart-client-server
```

### Terminal 1: Server Setup

1. Configure environment variables

   Create a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

   Then, add your API keys:

   ```
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd server
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Using `uv`? Create your venv using: `uv sync`

3. Run your server bot

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

   > Using `uv`? Run your bot using: `uv run bot.py`

   > ðŸ’¡ First run note: The initial startup may take ~15 seconds as Pipecat downloads required models, like the Silero VAD model.

### Terminal 2: Client Setup

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `client` folder:

   From the `pipecat-quickstart-client-server` directory, run:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Run the client:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Connect and test

**Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser** and click `Connect` to start talking to your bot.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Check your server terminal for debug logs showing Pipecat's internal workings.

## Troubleshooting

- **Browser permissions**: Make sure to allow microphone access when prompted by your browser.
- **Connection issues**: If the WebRTC connection fails, first try a different browser. If that fails, make sure you don't have a VPN or firewall rules blocking traffic. WebRTC uses UDP to communicate.
- **Audio issues**: Check that your microphone and speakers are working and not muted.
